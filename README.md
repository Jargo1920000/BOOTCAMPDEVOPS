# DevOps Bootcamp Portfolio

This repository shows hands on DevOps projects completed as part of a structured DevOps bootcamp.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate real world DevOps skills including cloud infrastructure, automation, CI CD pipelines, containers, Kubernetes, and monitoring.

All projects are built from scratch and follow common industry practices.

## What This Repository Demonstrates

- Practical experience with DevOps tools and workflows
- Ability to design, build, and deploy cloud based systems
- Strong focus on automation and repeatable processes
- Experience working across the full delivery lifecycle

## Why This Repo Matters

This repository reflects my ability to:
- Learn new tools quickly
- Build production style systems
- Automate manual processes
- Work with cloud native technologies

Each folder contains clear documentation and scripts to explain what was built and why.

## Status

This repository is actively updated as I progress through the bootcamp.
